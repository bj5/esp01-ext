## Getting Started

**NOTE:** This crate's dependencies are still in the early stages of development, and various features may be incomplete or missing altogether. With this being pre-`1.0` software, the public API is subject to change at any time.

### Prerequisites

Because the Xtensa target is not officially supported, you must use a custom fork of Rust. Pre-built artifacts for common operating systems are available via the [esp-rs/rust-build] repository's releases page. Alternatively, you can build the compiler from source; for more information on this process, please refer the the [esp-rs/rust] fork's README, which has detailed instructions for most popular operating systems.

You will additionally need the appropriate Xtensa toolchain. You can download pre-built binaries from [Espressif], or build them yourself using [esp-open-sdk]. In either case, make sure that the resulting binaries are in your `$PATH`.

[esp-open-sdk]: https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk

### Build the Examples

You can build all examples at once, or just build one at a time:

```bash
$ cargo build --release --examples
$ cargo build --release --example=blinky
```

### Flash the Device

### espflash

[espflash] is a community developed tool (written entirely in Rust) for flashing _ESP32-_ and _ESP8266-based_ devices. It provides a CLI tool for flashing the aforementioned devices as well as an additional crate, [cargo-espflash], which provides a cargo subcommand which compiles and flashes your device with one command.

For more information on these tools, please refer to their respective `README`s.

#### Examples

Make sure you replace `<PORT>` with the appropriate value prior to running either of the below commands.

Using `espflash`:

```bash
$ espflash <PORT> target/xtensa-esp8266-none/release/examples/blinky
```

Using `cargo-espflash`:

```bash
$ cargo espflash --release --example=blinky <PORT>
```

[cargo-espflash]: https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/tree/master/cargo-espflash

### esptool

You can use the official tool from Espressif, [esptool.py], to flash the firmware to your device. Make sure this has been installed and `esptool.py` is available in your `$PATH`.

First convert the ELF-formatted binary to a flashable image:

```bash
$ esptool.py \
>   --chip esp8266 \
>   elf2image \
>   target/xtensa-esp8266-none/release/examples/blinky
```

Then you're ready to flash the image to the device; make sure you replace `<PORT>` with the appropriate value prior to running the command:

```bash
$ esptool.py \
>   --port <PORT> \
>   write_flash \
>   -fm dio \
>   -fs 32m \
>   0x00000 \
>   target/xtensa-esp8266-none/release/examples/blinky-0x00000.bin
```
